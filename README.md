# Ochi Script

This ochi script is a collection of some scripts or tools that I use here and there, that I just wanted to put into one script...

To install it, just grab the `ochi` file and add it to your path, or run this to get it installed:

```bash
# Install: 
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefferyb/useful-scripts/master/ochi | bash -s install
```
This will add it to `${HOME}/.local/bin`. If it's not in your path, you can add `export PATH=$PATH:${HOME}/.local/bin` to your ${HOME}/.bashrc or ${HOME}/.profile or ${HOME}/.zsh file

## Options

`install::fluxcd`: Install FluxCD CLI using https://fluxcd.io/docs/cmd/#install-using-bash

`install::kapp`: Install kapp CLI using https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/develop/install/#via-script-macos-or-linux
